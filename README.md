### Hi there, I'm Victor ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist and an enthusiast of software craftsmanship and design. I strive for writing code that is both useful and beautiful to look at, or as I like to call it, [katana-code](https://victorvalentee.github.io/#katana-code-principles).


#### :telescope: Current Projects
I'm currently a Tech Lead @ The Linux Foundation. My primary role is to support the design, implementation, and maintenance processes for the datalake product. I work with a team of 6-10 distributed multi-cultural engineers. Three more continents and we can call ourselves a global team! Any *antarctican* devs out there?


#### :newspaper: Facts
- I do most of my coding in Python :snake: and Bash
- I like to write tests first :test_tube:
- I enjoy pair-programming sessions :two:
- I absolutely need dark themes :goggles:
